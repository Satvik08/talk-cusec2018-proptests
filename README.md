I gave a short talk at CUSEC2018 on randomized testing, with some
practical strategies for using property testing immediately.  The
slide source is [here](slides.org).

Here are some resources for learning more about property testing:

 - [Hypothesis](http://hypothesis.works/)
 - [propEr testing](https://propertesting.com/)
 - [theft's guide to coming up with properties](https://github.com/silentbicycle/theft/blob/master/doc/properties.md)
